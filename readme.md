**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

In this project, we are asked to write the code ourselves to find the lines of a self-driving car initially based on the still pictures and then using the video provided. Even though analysising videos seems to be harder, but the pipeline of the whole process should be same. The video is just a sum of the still pictures. So I will take the still picture as an example.
